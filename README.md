The PulseFire project was designed as a wireless-controlled embedded system that integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) and Wi-Fi connectivity to enable real-time control and monitoring. The GUI serves as the user interaction layer, allowing intuitive command input and system visualization, while the Wi-Fi connectivity enables reliable wireless communication between the controller and the embedded hardware. This combination demonstrates the practical application of digital communication concepts, user-interface design, and wireless data transmission in a single functional prototype.
